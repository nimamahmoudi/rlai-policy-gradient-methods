# Reinforcement Learning for Artificial Intelligence: Policy Gradient Methods

This repository contains all the codes and experiments I will be doing for my Reinforcement Learning in AI II course.

I will try and refine the environment later on to make it match the OpenAI Gym library syntax so that other people could easily use it.

A video of the environment can be found [here](https://youtu.be/GZZFaRAdZng).

The implemented environment looks something like this:

The agents implemented in this repo are classical policy gradient method agents written from scratch which are mentioned in Rich Sutton's book "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction". It is easy to find the PDF version on Rich Sutton's website. The code inside the repo is self explanatory in jupyter notebooks which makes them pretty easy to read and understand. In case you have any questions, contact me for extra info.

I will include the final writeup of my project after it is done in this repo for anyone interested on working in this area larter on.

You can contact me via my email in my Github account for more information.
